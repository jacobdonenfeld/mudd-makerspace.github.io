# mudd-makerspace.github.io
Harvey Mudd College Makerspace Website

This branch (develop) hosts the source code of the site. The site is built using MkDocs, and deployed on a Github organization site. 

Follow the instructions here to deploy: [MkDocs Deploying your docs tutorials](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/) . Notice that when using gh-deploy, -b flag needs to be set to master so that it is writing to the master branch instead of the default gh-page branch.
