## About

![The Mudd Makerspace](/images/muddMakerspace.jpg)
The Mudd Makerspace is a student-run club for providing access to tools, resources, space, and storage to work on extra-curricular projects. We are dedicated to making this a space where all students feel comfortable working on a variety of projects, from electronics to sewing or artistic endeavours. In the makerspace, you can find sewing machines, drills, saws, soldering irons, electronics components, and space to use them all.

## Location

Parsons B132

## Access

To gain 24-hour access to the Mudd Makerspace, you need to pass the [safety quiz](https://goo.gl/forms/xZQdCQUqr74EaqwV2).

## Project Storage

If you'd like to store projects you're working on in the Makerspace, please make sure to take the safety quiz and check out a storage space [here]().

## Request Funding

Once that has been approved, you can either buy supplies yourself and [get reimbursed](https://goo.gl/forms/8Rb888cmWaUV7qaj2) or [request supplies](https://goo.gl/forms/a2Hki4hfWitAUHXq2).
