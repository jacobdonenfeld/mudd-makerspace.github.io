These rules are meant to make the space safe, inviting, and effective for all students and for all projects. When you sign up to join the makerspace, you are agreeing to follow these rules, and to help build the maker community through your use of the space. Remember that it is a privilege - follow the honor code and act with respect for the room, the tools, and most of all your fellow students.\n\n\nProjects\n\n\nReimbursements\n\n\n\n\nWe offer $100 per person, per project. Funding approval is determined with the \nproject petition form\n. If you do not receive approval with this form, reimbursement is not guaranteed. As an individual, you may only have funding for one project at a time. Team projects must verify that all members listed are active participants. You may receive funding for an individual project and a group project at the same time, but all project funding remains at the leadership\u2019s discretion.\n\n\nA project is viewed as completed when you deliver an (informal) write-up with pictures and information about your project, to be displayed on the website and to help future makers. \n\n\nWhen there are parts that you want to buy for a project, either buy them yourself and fill out the \nreimbursement form\n, or if you don\u2019t want to buy materials directly and get reimbursed, fill out the \nmaterials request form\n. If you have any questions, contact makerspace-leadership-l. \n\n\n\n\nStorage\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to store your project in the makerspace, fill out the \nproject storage form\n. This form must be completed to store anything in project storage. Please fill out the form.\n\n\nYour project must fit on the shelves- if it cannot, it is too large to be stored in the makerspace. \n\n\nProject storage lasts for an academic year. At the end of the year you must remove your project. You will get email reminders, but if you do not remove your project, or have an approved exception (ie, we usually extend project storage over the summer for students on campus for research- come talk to us), we do not guarantee the safety of your project. It may be thrown away, or recycled into stock parts. Please get your project at the end of the year- we don\u2019t want to throw anyone\u2019s project away, but space limitations mean that we cannot store anyone\u2019s project indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\n\n\nThe physical space limits the projects and storage we can support. Your project must be able to fit on the storage shelves without overflowing. \n\n\nWe do not allow projects which cannot be returned to storage (either in the space or outside of it) after every use, nor do we allow projects which damage the space.\n\n\nDo not use the makerspace for projects for which this room is not appropriate- this includes projects with large quantities of machine grease, paint, food, fumes which pose safety risks, electrical hazards, plants, beads, or glitter.\n\n\nAll projects must follow ASHMC bylaws for use of funding. \n\n\n\n\nSafety\n\n\n\n\nTake the \nsafety quiz\n to gain access, and read this document in full.\n\n\nCheck in on the sheet outside the door, and check out when you leave.\n\n\nBe aware of the space around you whenever you or anyone else is working.\n\n\nDo not leave anything (tools or materials) in the common space when you leave the room. Leave the space as clean as you found it, and please clean any messes you find.\n\n\nRead safety data sheets and standard operating procedures for everything before you use it for the first time.\n\n\n\n\nPPE\n\n\n\n\nPersonal protective equipment is stored throughout the makerspace. Safety glasses are located on the front shelving unit, and near the computer and sewing machine. \n\n\nA face shield is found on the front shelving unit. \n\n\nHearing protection ear muffs (not the fuzzy kind) are located on the front shelving unit. Use them as appropriate, and whenever anyone in the space is using a power tool.\n\n\nLatex gloves are available for using epoxies, wood stain, and other messy things. Do not wear gloves when using power tools.\n\n\n\n\nPower Tools\n\n\n\n\nTo access power tools, you must first pass an \nadditional safety quiz\n, testing particular knowledge of all of the tools in the cabinet. You will then be given the combination to the cabinet.\n\n\nIt is an honor code violation to share the combination with anyone who has not passed the power tool safety quiz. Do not share it.\n\n\nPower tools will be marked with fluorescent spray paint, denoting that they belong in the cabinet. Put them back in the cabinet when you are done.\n\n\nRead the standard operating procedures for any tool before you use it. Be sure you know exactly how the tool works and all of the ways it can hurt you or those around you.\n\n\nPower tools must be used with a buddy (who does not need to have passed the power tool quiz, but who does need to have passed the general safety quiz, and must be sober and able to assist in an emergency) whether in the makerspace or not.\n\n\nYou are responsible for the tool the entire time it is out of the cabinet, and it must be put back into the cabinet as soon as you are done with it.\n\n\n\n\nFlammables Cabinet\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to store propane, or any other flammable materials as part of a project, it is your responsibility to talk to makerspace leadership so that we can store those materials in the flammables cabinet.\n\n\nIf you want access to the flammables cabinet for stock materials stored there, notify leadership and we will arrange access or give you a key. Access is contingent on other students\u2019 availability, so plan ahead. Access is not guaranteed at all hours.\n\n\n\n\nWood Stains, Spray Paint, and Fumes\n\n\n\n\nThese materials can be kept in the makerspace, but all use of wood stains or spray paints must occur outside in a well ventilated area. \n\n\nPut down paper (found in the back of the makerspace) to protect the ground from paint.\n\n\nIt is your responsibility to research chemicals you are using, and use them outside if they pose any danger- the makerspace has no ventilation (even in the spray booth), so please err on the safe side.\n\n\n\n\nSpray Booth and MARC/Rocketry\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spray booth is not currently operational because the filters need changing. If you want to use this, please talk to Penny Manisco in the Chemistry Department. She can be found in Jacobs 2314, or at pmanisco (a) hmc [dot] edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to use the rocketry equipment, it is fully your responsibility to get trained, arrange the safe use of equipment, and notify relevant parties: makerspace leadership (mudd-makerspace-l), Penny Manisco (pmanisco (at) hmc [dot] edu), Theresa Lauer (tlauer (at) hmc [dot] edu), and Prof Spjut (spjut (at) hmc [dot] edu). Logistical and safety arrangements must be made with, and approved by them. When and if you have their approval, we will give you the key to the MARC and rocketry equipment. Otherwise it is to remain locked for the safety of everyone using the makerspace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsequences\n\n\n\n\nIf found engaging in behavior which endangers yourself or others, you will be subject to a community service penalty. This will take the form of an hour spent cleaning or organizing the makerspace. (Optimally, this will occur during office hours, or otherwise will work with your schedule.) \n\n\nIf a makerspace user fails to complete this community service, or is found breaking the rules 3 times (even with community service completed), they will lose swipe access, and will be barred from entering the makerspace for 2 semesters. At the end of that time they will be able to retake the safety quizzes and regain their access.\n\n\nPunishments are subject to leadership\u2019s discretion- if unsafe behavior is especially egregious, or results in injury, loss of access may be immediate, or last for more than 2 semesters.\n\n\nThe space is not supervised, so constant enforcement is not feasible. Students realizing that they have broken the rules, especially the buddy system for power tools, or having engaged in unsafe behavior are encouraged to self-report.\n\n\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\nComputer\n\n\n\n\nPlease ask before downloading especially large files.\n\n\nThere is an Oculus Rift connected to the computer; this is available for students looking to develop games for it.\n\n\nUse of the computer for gaming or other frivolous purposes is not prohibited, but comes second to anyone else attempting to use it for an academic or nonacademic project. If this becomes an issue gaming, etc. will become prohibited. Make sure you logout of facebook or any other accounts when you are done working.\n\n\nBe aware of students around and the danger they or their equipment may pose to you. You are required to wear safety glasses if anyone is using power tools.\n\n\nPlease don\u2019t use this computer for piracy or inappropriate content. \n\n\n\n\nSewing Machine\n\n\n\n\nPlease replace bobbins after use if you use unusual thread.\n\n\nBe especially sure that you don\u2019t leave needles on the floor. There is a magnet available for finding them if dropped.\n\n\nBe aware of students around and the danger they or their equipment may pose to you. You are required to wear safety glasses if anyone is using power tools.\n\n\nNo beads or glitter are allowed in the makerspace due to the difficulty of cleaning.\n\n\n\n\nElectronics Table\n\n\n\n\nPick up all of your wire scraps. Return unused components to their bins after working.\n\n\nThere is a water bottle to keep sponges wet for soldering. There are also sinks down the hall.\n\n\nBe aware that some solder has lead. Don\u2019t eat it. Use the smoke absorber to reduce fumes.\n\n\nDon\u2019t leave soldering irons on if they are not being used. Please coat the tips in solder when you are done to prevent them from oxidizing.\n\n\nIf you are going to use a significant number of a single component, fill out a project reimbursement request rather than emptying our common supplies.\n\n\n\n\nMain Table\n\n\n\n\nThe only things that belong on this table are the two power reels. All other items must be removed after use.\n\n\nBe aware of the plastic top of the table- it is replaceable but expensive. If your work will melt, burn, cut, stain, or stick to the tabletop, put down paper or do it outside. Butcher paper for covering the table can be found in a cart on the back wall.\n\n\n\n\nTool Checkout Policy\n\n\n\n\nAny tool can be checked out, provided you have access to it.\n\n\nWhen you take a tool out of the makerspace, sign the tool out with the tool checkout sheet on the door.\n\n\nAll tools must be returned within one week of checking them out. If you are still using it, you may check it out again.",
